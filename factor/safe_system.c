/*
 * safe_system.c
 * Thread-safe version of system() for platforms needing it, like Cygwin.
 *
 * Copyright Â© 2018 Mark A. Geisert.  Placed in public domain.
 *
 * POSIX states that system() need not be thread-safe.  On Cygwin it isn't.
 * POSIX also states that system() cannot return to its caller until the
 * task it has spawned has completed.
 *
 * If a Cygwin process uses system() simultaneously from multiple pthreads,
 * the Cygwin DLL reports internal errors and often hangs the process.  This
 * is easily worked around by wrapping system() calls in a critical section.
 * However, doing this has the effect of running the (potentially long
 * duration) task spawned by system() while holding the critical section the
 * entire time.  This behavior ends up serializing the pthreads that use
 * system() and the benefits of parallelization are lost.
 *
 * After investigation of various approaches, what is done here is to launch
 * the spawned task as a background task, obtain its pid, and wait for that
 * pid to become invalid (which indicates the task has completed or aborted).
 *
 * Unfortunately, Plan A: waiting for the task with the usual waitpid() or
 * wait() cannot be done because the task of interest is not a direct child
 * of the running process.  There is a shell process interposed, as required
 * by POSIX for system() usage.
 *
 * Implemented here is Plan C: a Windows handle to the spawned task/process
 * (not the shell) is waited upon.  On platforms other than Windows or Cygwin,
 * Plan B described below might be workable.
